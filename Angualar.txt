 Angular is a full features JS framework created and maintatined by Google and  is used for building front-end applications or the front-end part of a full stack application. Angular is very popular in arge enterprise.

Why Use Angular?
1. Organized front-end structure (Components, Modules, Services)
2. Extremely powerful and full featured
3. All in one solution (Routing, HTTP, RxJS, etc.)
4. Build powerful SPA apps
5. Follows MVC Pattern
6. Typescript
7. Fantastic CLI

The Angular Way
1. Uses TypeScript for static types (variables, functions, params)
2. Componenents based (Like other framework)
3. Uses "services" to share data/functionality between Components
4. Concepts of "modules" (root module, forms module, http module, etc.)
5. Uses RxJS "observables" for async operations
6. Steep learning curve relatvive to other frameworks

Angular CLI - Powerful tool for generating apps, modules, components, services, etc.
1. ng new myapp - create new application
2. ng serve - run dev server
3. ng build - will build out static assests
// To generate component/ service/ module
4. ng generate component todos - create new component
5. ng generate service todo - create new services
6. ng generate module app-routing - create new modules

A note on State Management
You can use state managers like ngrx and Redux with Angular for larger apps

I find it less necessary due to the overall structure of the framework and services which are used to share data and functionality.

The Anatomy of Componenent
import { Component , OnInit} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  title = 'w8ang';
  name: string = 'Sunny';
  age: number = 25;

  constructor("services import here"){}
  ngOnInit(){
      // runs when component is created
  }
}
